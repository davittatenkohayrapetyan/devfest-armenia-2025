While in Kubernetes Argo Rollouts excels at Progressive Delivery and automated rollbacks to mitigate deployment issues, what if we could go a step further?</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">This session explores how to elevate your release process by integrating Agentic AI using Google Gemini and Google Jules, an Asynchronous Coding Agent, with Argo Rollouts canary deployments on GKE. We'll demonstrate how an intelligent agent can automatically analyze logs when a rollout fails, pinpointing the root cause. Beyond diagnosis, these agents can take proactive steps on your behalf, suggesting and even implementing code fixes as new pull requests, which can be redeployed automatically after PR review. This approach moves us closer to truly self-healing deployments.</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">Join us to learn how to combine the power of Kubernetes and Argo Rollouts with the autonomous capabilities of Agentic AI using Gemini and Google Jules, achieving a release experience that is not only seamless but also resilient.</p>\n      </div>\n    ",

This talk introduces a practical framework for “Semantic CI/CD,” where LLMs automatically evaluate other LLMs using robust, binary scoring—no humans and no heuristics. Building on findings from Gaming the Answer Matcher, we show that judge models are far more robust than commonly assumed and can act as reliable gatekeepers in production pipelines.</p>\n      </div>\n    ",

But what, exactly, are these powerful frameworks automating away?</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">This provocative talk, \"What candies are Agentic AI frameworks stealing from developers?\", explores how modern Agentic frameworks abstract key parts of the system flow. We will clarify and reproduce core agent responsibilities, such as tool orchestration and the Agent control loop, demonstrating exactly how these are being absorbed by the framework. This is not just a high-level discussion; it is a practical lesson on framework design and architectural knowledge essential before building agents. By analyzing which \"candies\" are being \"stolen,\" attendees will gain the clarity needed to focus their future skill development in where it's being expected that developers invest their craft.</p>\n      </div>\n    ",

Our menu is huge: you can customize drinks with or without milk, change ice, add syrups, literally millions of combinations. Too big for a static UI. So we thought: why not let AI guide the user?

I bring over 15 years of experience across US, Canadian, and European companies, both startups and enterprises. My career started as a C++ developer working in electronic design automation and high-performance trading systems (6+ years, mostly at Questrade). Later, I transitioned into iOS development, contributing to companies such as Workfront (acquired by Adobe), Zero (now Hercules.ai), and Disqo for another 6+ years. For the past few years, I’ve been leading engineering at Softr, while still remaining hands-on in coding (around 70% of my time, primarily in Java).</p>\n\n      </div>\n    "
