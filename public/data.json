Go has quietly become a favorite for building the infrastructure behind Al - from API gateways and streaming responses to agent runtimes and data pipelines.</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">In this talk, I'll show why Go's simplicity, concurrency model, and reliability make it great for Al backends. We'll look at examples of how Go powers fast, scalable services around large language models, and what lessons Go engineers can borrow from the Al world (and vice versa).</p>\n      </div>\n    ",

We’ll explore how A2A enables autonomous agents to communicate, delegate tasks, and coordinate across distributed systems, moving beyond simple tool invocation toward true agent ecosystems. Through real-world workflows, you’ll see how agents discover each other, exchange structured messages, and orchestrate multi-step interactions. By the end, you’ll understand the architectural principles behind A2A and how to apply them to build scalable, collaborative AI solutions.</p>\n      </div>\n    ",

Our menu is huge: you can customize drinks with or without milk, change ice, add syrups, literally millions of combinations. Too big for a static UI. So we thought: why not let AI guide the user? What if you could just say: “It’s hot today, give me something refreshing”. And boom, the app recommends the perfect drink for you. That’s exactly what we’re building in Drinkit.</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">I believe this talk will be useful because it’s a real production case of applying Firebase AI, not just sandbox examples. Attendees will see how we combined speech-to-text, Firebase AI models, and function calls to handle a huge menu (2M+ token context!) and deliver an interactive, personalized ordering experience. Developers will walk away with inspiration, code examples, and practical lessons on how to quickly bootstrap AI features in their own apps.</p>\n      </div>\n    ",
