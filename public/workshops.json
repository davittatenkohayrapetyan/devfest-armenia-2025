    "description": "From Initialization to Ideation to Prompting to Deployment. All of these and the intermediate steps will be covered in the creation of your own Agent application. We all know about AI, but this is much more than that, it is making sure the AI is deployed and available in the most consistent way possible with all the requirements for application development including version control, testing and scaling being covered. You will be given credits to follow along on the workshop.",

    "description": "As AI gets smarter — coding, making presentations, even writing texts (maybe this one too!) — let’s invest in what can’t be delegated to machines: emotional intelligence.\n \n\n This hands-on workshop is built around simple, practical exercises that strengthen key soft skills — listening, collaboration, and learning — with a special focus on how to give advice the right way.\n Expect minimal theory, maximum practice, and a few unexpected stories along the way.\n \n\n Come with an open mind and be ready to take part.\n At the very least, it’ll be fun — and at best, surprisingly useful. \uD83C\uDF3F",
